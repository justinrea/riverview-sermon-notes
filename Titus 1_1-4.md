**A Church Built Through Preaching**  
Titus 1:1-4

**We are Servants of Our Lord (1:1)**

* We are **slaves**.  
  * We have been bought with the **blood** of Christ. (1 Peter 1:18-19)  
  * We now **belong** to Christ. (1 Cor. 6:19-20)  
* We are **sent**.   
  * To **evangelize** sinners. “*For the sake of the faith…”*  
  * To **edify** the saints. “*And their knowledge of the truth…*”  
* We are **selected**.  
  * John 15:16  
  * Acts 13:46-48  
  * Romans 9:13-16  
  * Ephesians 1:4-5  
  * 1 Thessalonians 1:4-5  
  * 2 Thessalonians 2:13  
* We are **sanctified**.   
  * The gospel should lead to godliness.  
  * Bad theology usually leads to sinful behavior.  
    * What you believe will affect how you **live**.  
    * How you live will demonstrate what you believe.  
  * To be godly is to be **Christlike**.

**We are Secure in the Lord (1:2)**

* We have His witness.  
  * He is the God who never **lies**.   
* We have His word.   
  * He has promised us eternal **life**. 

**We are Saved by the Lord (1:3)**

* The mission is our **godliness**.  
* The message is the **gospel**.  
* The motivation is his **grace**.   
* The method is through preaching sent by **God**. 

**We are Separated unto the Lord (1:4)**

* We share a common **faith**.   
* We are in God’s **family**. 

**God’s Highway of Grace**

* The Father chose (*in the distant past*) a people to save.  
* The Son came (*in the recent past*) to save his people.  
* The Spirit produces faith (*in the present*) in the people being saved.  
* Godliness issues (*in the near future*) from the people of faith.  
* Hope (*in the distant future*) frees the people of faith to be zealous, productive, godly doers.

*God our Savior commanded and entrusted his servant, the apostle Paul, to preach his word to make known at just the right time the eternal life he had promised in eternity past by producing godliness and Christlikeness in the elect by giving them knowledge of the truth and bringing them to saving faith in Christ.*
