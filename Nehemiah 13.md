**There is a Need for Spiritual Leadership**

  * Lead **courageously**. (15-22)  
  * Show anger righteously. (23-29)  
  * Serve God **faithfully**. (30-31)  
* The Question for Us…  
  * Nehemiah was not a **pastor**…  
  * Not a **preacher**…  
  * But only a cupbearer to the king, and God used him greatly…  
  * What could God do through us if we were fully surrendered to him? 


**There is a Hope of a Coming Savior**

* Nehemiah forces us to look for a greater **leader**.   
  * Jesus didn’t come from a Persian palace. He came from the throne of **heaven**.   
  * Jesus didn’t come to rebuild a wall. He came to **redeem** a people.   
  * The people were like sheep without a shepherd. He came to be their good shepherd.
