* What was the problem?  
  * There was an **\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_** crisis.   
  * There was **\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_** of the poor.   
  * They were charging **\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_** interest.

**The Great Assembly: Your Spending Reveals Your Soul (5:6-13)** 

* Feel Nehemiah’s anger…  
  * They were treating the people like business instead of **\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_**.  
  * What they were doing may not have been illegal, but it was **\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_**.  
* See Nehemiah’s control…  
  * Politicians ask, “What is **\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_**?”

  * They displayed repentance.  
    * Repentance is saying, “I was **\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_**.”

**The Great Example: Increases your Standard of Giving, not Your Standard of Living (5:14-19)**

* The example of Nehemiah…  
  * Nehemiah used his position for other’s good instead of personal **\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_**.  
  * There are three ways to live your life.   
    * Selfish- What’s mine is **\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_**. (ungodly rich)  
    * Stealing- What’s yours is also **\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_**. (ungodly rich and government)  
    * Steward- What’s mine is **\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_**. (Nehemiah)  
  * You have two choices…  
    * You can choose to live for **\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_** day…  
    * Or you can choose to live for the **\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_** day. “*Remember… O my God, all I have done…”*  
* The example of Jesus…  
  * He gave up his rights so that we could receive his **\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_**.  
  * He gave up his privileges so we could enjoy his **\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_**.   
  * He gave up his crown to embrace our **\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_**.  
  * He gave up his throne so we could enter his **\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_**.
